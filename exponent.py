# Program which rise one number to the power of second number

num1 = input("Please write your first number. It will be base of exponent.\n")
num2 = input("Write your second number. It will be exponent.\n")
result = float(num1) ** float(num2)
print(f"{num1} to the power of {num2}. The result is: {result}")
